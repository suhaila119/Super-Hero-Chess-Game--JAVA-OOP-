##Super-Hero Themed Chess Game Using Java Object Oriented Programming (OOP)##

##Game Description##

Super Heroes Chess (SHC) is a two-player strategic board game inspired by traditional chess.
The main difference is that the pieces represent superheroes with super powers or advanced
abilities alongside their sidekicks, instead of the traditional pieces. Each different hero piece
has a unique power that performs a certain purpose. The sidekick pieces are there to aid the
heroes in their mission. The main objective of the game is to deliver a payload over to the base
of the opposing player by eliminating a specific number of their pieces, rather than eliminating
theking piece in the traditional chess.
